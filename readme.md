# Simple windows activator

I was bored so I decided copy the mechanism of this [proyect](https://github.com/wrrulos/WinFree/blob/main/WinFree.bat) that do the same but written in Go :P

#### Features

- Simple (no animations)

- Activate you windows version in less than 1 second

- Does it work? (I don't know because I couldn't find people to test it)
